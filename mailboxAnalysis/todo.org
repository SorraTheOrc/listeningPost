Social Graph
============

Settings
--------

The weights and maxage of emails is hard coded into to social graph view. These need to be brought
out into config files.

---

Keywords
--------

Keyword filtering on replies would allow us to rate replies as "thanks", "requests", "code", "angry", "happy" etc. This in turn would allow us to say that the relationship between A and B is 80% about code, but they are 20% angry with one another.
