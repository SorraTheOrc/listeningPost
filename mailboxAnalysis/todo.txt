Social Graph
============

Currently the social graph only considers replies to a person as being important. We need to also count replies from a person. For example:

A posts mail 1
B replies to 1 (relationship with A)
A posts mail 2
C replies to 2 (relationship with A)
A replies to B1 (relationship with B)

The relationship between A and B should be stronger than the one between A and C.

Currently all replies are equally weighted. We should provide a decay setting that allows us to make more recent links more important.

---

Keyword filtering on replies would allow us to rate replies as "thanks", "requests", "code", "angry", "happy" etc. This in turn would allow us to say that the relationship between A and B is 80% about code, but they are 20% angry with one another.
