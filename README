This is an early stage project, and is largely a weekend hack, although I do use it myself so hopefully I'll conitnue to find it useful and continue to enhance it. I encourage you to contribute your own ideas and code.

There are lots of things to do ranging from making the ugly interface better through to adding additional analysis.

Features
--------

 * Import a mailbox archive
 * Build a social graph from those archives
