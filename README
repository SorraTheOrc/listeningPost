=============

This is an application that analysis community interactions in order to help 
understnad the social dynamics found within it.

Status
======

This is an early stage project, and is largely a weekend hack, although I do 
use it myself so hopefully I'll continue to find it useful and continue to 
enhance it. I encourage you to contribute your own ideas and code.

There are lots of things to do ranging from making the ugly interface better 
through to adding additional analysis.

Features
--------

 * Retrieve emails from a POP3 account
 * Automatically assign tasks based on regular expression matches
 * Import a mailbox archive
 * Build a social graph from communication archives
 * Automatically create a ticket, upon email import, to ensure emails are 
   responded to in an appropriate time

Installation

It is necessary to patch the helpdesk to allow resources to be recorded against
tickets. See http://code.google.com/p/jutda-helpdesk/issues/detail?id=155
